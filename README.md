# vision-transformer-project-api
Vision Transformer Project API is a containerized Python service for ML deployment. Using an OOP approach, it serves a Hugging Face ViT model via REST API. The system processes image inputs through high-level inference, serializing classification data into a Binary Large Object (Blob) for robust, scalable data storage.
